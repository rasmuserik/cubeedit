# Cubeedit

**Under development, not working yet!** 

Prototype deployed to https://cubeedit.solsort.com

Just an app skeleton so far.

The purpose is to create a simple online tool for creating and sharing 3d block based content.

(My 7 year old son, likes to make stuff in Minecraft™, and I would prefer this to be in an open environment, where his creations could be shared and preserved).

Roadmap:

- Simple world-editing (implement via noa-engine)
- Save to leveldb
- Fly mode
- World Export/import
- Touch-support
- VR-support
- Editable 16x16 block textures.
- Multiplayer
- Wild idea: 16x16x16 voxels instead of textures.

Based on:

- [Noa game engine](https://github.com/andyhall/noa)
- [Minetest texturepack – Hand Painted Pack by Drummyfish](https://gitlab.com/drummyfish/minetest-texturepack)
